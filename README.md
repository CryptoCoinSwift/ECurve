======
[CryptoCoinSwift](https://github.com/CryptoCoinSwift/CryptoCoinFramework) components for eleptic curve math in Swift.

Based on [ECurve](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/ecurve/) from the CryptoCoinJS project.

A [playground for FFInt](FFInt.playground/section-1.swift) shows examples of [Finite Field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) math.

A [playground for ECurve](ECurve doc.playground/section-1.swift) shows examples of [Elliptic Curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve) math.
